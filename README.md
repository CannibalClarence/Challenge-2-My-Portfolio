## Notes
Because I only have 1 project I am actually able to put into my portfolio, I added my band and href link to a youtube video, just to have some extra content. 
obviously my band will not be in my final portfolio.
I did not make the first application bigger than the other(s), according to the acceptance criteria, since I only have 2 "technically 1" application so it made my page look unappealing. so I made one or the other grow bigger when you hover over it. it looked better that way. If you want me to change that then I will, no problem.
Screen shot looks funny because I have Backround-attchments Fixed so its hard to take a proper screen shot.
I had a hard time with the meadia query so any and all feedback is great and needed.
