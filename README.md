## Notes
Because I only have 1 project I am able to put into my portfolio, I added my band so I could properly showcase the gallery img's getting bigger than their siblings when you hover over them with your cursor.
WHEN you click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
WHEN you click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.
