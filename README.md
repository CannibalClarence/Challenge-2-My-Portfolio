## Notes
<ul>
  <li>
  Because I only have 1 project I am actually able to put into my portfolio, I added my band and href link to a youtube video, just to have some extra content. 
  obviously my band will not be in my final portfolio.
  </li>
  <li>
  I did not make the first application bigger than the other(s), according to the acceptance criteria, since I only have 2 "technically 1" application so it made my     page look unappealing. so I made both boxes grow bigger when you hover over it instead. It looked better that way. If you want me to change that, then I will, no         problem.
  </li>
  <li>
  Screen shot looks funny because I have Backround-attchments Fixed so its hard to take a proper screen shot.
  </li>
  <li>
  I had a hard time with the meadia query so any and all feedback is great and needed. But I feel I did accomplish what I was asked to do.
  </li>
  <li> 
  All of my starter commit messages dissapeard since i had a problem where i was sending everything to the wrong repository. I did not notice until i was almost       finished with the code, so i had to create a new repo and sent all my code to that one.
  </li>
